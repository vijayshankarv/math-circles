#Math circles lesson Feb 25 
## Algorithms (for optimization?)

How do you want to introduce the topic? - the brief introduction and jumping straight in last time was not very successful. 
History? 
Examples? 
Motivation from a technical standpoint? 

What are the basic ideas to cover in the introduction? 


Plan is to cover divide and conquer (binary search) using the coin weighing puzzle - get them to generalize the result to powers of 2 to think about growth of steps  
(give additional problems to think about - 12 coins, 9 coins etc. 

This approach is better thought of as decrease and conquer [1] because the number of problems to be solved decreases at each step. 
In divide and conquer methods, the size of the problems decrease, but the number of problems increase. 



Splitting trees can help grasp the growth better and easily

How to transition from divide and conquer to dynamic programming ideas? - They all know fibonacci numbers - is calculating fibonacci of n with some constraints on the number of steps a good example? 

and then move on to the egg drop puzzle and
