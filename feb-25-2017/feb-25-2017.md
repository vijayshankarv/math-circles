### * A Fake among nine coins 
a) There are nine identical-looking coins; one of these coins is counterfeit and is known to be lighter than the genuine coins. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the fake coin with a two-pan balance scale without weights?

b) Can you try to generalize this to the case where the number of coins is a power of three?
